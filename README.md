5. Utilize console.log and the inspector tool to test our theory
6. Code based on planned process
7. Run code at every step to ensure no bug

<h2>Details</h2>

The CSS for this project is very straightforward until the function. In order to create an random password. I first created 4 array containing all the characters the password can contain. Next, I created an empty password array. Then I combine the IF function and the WHILE function to loop each item of the 4 arrays into the empty password array i created. Once the password array reached the desire length that user choose, the loop will stop, returning me an array containing my password. To display it as a regular password format, I convert the password array into a string and add it to the password container's value. Everytime you click on the "generate password" button, it will re-run the function and give you a new passowrd.
